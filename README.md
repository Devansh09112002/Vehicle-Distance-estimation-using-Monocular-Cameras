# Object-tracking-Detection-
The program utilizes the YOLOv3 algorithm to detect objects from 80 classes with high accuracy. It is capable of detecting multiple objects within a single frame, and can also count the number of cars detected in a frame while calculating the distance of each vehicle from the camera. Furthermore, it can capture an image of the detected object.
